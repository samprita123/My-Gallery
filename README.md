# My-Gallery
here a simple website has been created using HTML & CSS. 
Here, many pictures have been added by using the image tag inside the HTML file, filter: gray scales have been used on all of them, and by hovering it over the image, a filter effect has been added.
Basically we can tell that very important things about HTML and CSS have been discussed in this website, it will be very useful for those who are learning it as a beginner.
